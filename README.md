# Picross-Solver
Use this tool to solve Picross puzzles.

To use, first input the criteria for rows separated by commas. For example if your rows must be "1", "1 3", "3", "1 1", "1 1", then you would input "1, 1 3, 3, 1 1, 1 1". Then you should input your columns criteria similarly for when doing it for rows. An example may be "1, 3, 2, 5, 1". When you run this example, the output you should get is:
. . . @ .
@ . @ @ @
. @ @ @ .
